## usage

Clone this repository and open this URL in a browser (replace `{your-github-name}` and `{any-url}`):

```
{your-github-name}.github.io/RedirAction/?delay=1000&text=wait a second you are being redirected&url={any-url}
```

These params are optional:

* `url`
* `delay`
* `text`

## Example with my clone: 

Open this URL to be redirected to lexoyo.me after 1s:
`http://lexoyo.github.io/RedirAction/?delay=1000&text=wait a second you are being redirected&url=http://lexoyo.me`

## why?

I needed this to have the time to open an URL on my phone, and share it before it is redirected. And this was to be able to track the IP of a stolen device with firefox sync enabled. Questions and comment are welcome in the issues.
